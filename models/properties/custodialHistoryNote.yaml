  that do not come to NARA through the regular government records transfer process. Provides

    In 1983 the U.S. Air Force loaned its pre-1945 and Korean War-era photographs and 
    related documentation (including the subject index) to the National Air and Space
    Museum, Smithsonian Institution, in accordance with a Memorandum of Agreement. The
    purpose of the loan was, in part, to enable the National Air and Space Museum to
    produce a videodisc of the collection. The records remained at the museum until 1998
    when they were accessioned into the National Archives.

    The nucleus of the Stephen T. Mather Collection was placed in the Prints and Photographs
    Division of the Library of Congress in 1945. In 1954 it was transferred back to the
    National Park Service (NPS). While the collection was housed at the Library of Congress,
    the NPS added to it on a regular basis. No additions to the collection were made after
    1954. The National Archives accessioned the Mather Collection in 1963.
