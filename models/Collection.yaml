title: Collection
description: >-
  An artificial accumulation of documents brought together on the basis of some
  characteristic (e.g. means of acquisition, creator, subject, language, medium, form, name
  of collector) without regard to the provenance of the documents. The Presidential libraries
  often organize their archival materials by collections, which primarily fall into
  three categories: donated historical materials (relating to all Presidencies, Hoover-Bush),
  Presidential records (applying to Presidencies since Reagan), and Presidential historical
  materials (Nixon.)
