        An organized unit (file, volume, etc.) of documents grouped together
        either for  current use or in the process of archival arrangement. For
        NARA's descriptive practices,  the file unit is the intellectual
        handling of the record item, which may or may not be  the physical
        handling. In other words, a folder does not necessarily equal a file
        unit.  For example, a case file may be in several physical folders, but
        is described as one file unit. For electronic records, the definition of
        a file unit level may be difficult. A file does not necessarily refer to
        a tape or to a particular data file.
